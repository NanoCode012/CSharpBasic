# CSharpBasic
My documentation on the basics of C# through practical examples.

Hello there! So you’re someone who’ve stumbled upon this repo. Feel free to check it out. I’m basically putting together what I’ve learnt on C# for others, that means you!

15/Sept : It's been a short while since I uploaded to this repo for the first time. I believe I've added most of the content for this repo, so there'll be less and less content update. After my progress meter reaches 100%, I'll only commit fixes and update previous code(please if there are any issues, report it to me through the 'Issues' tab), then I'll work on my second CSharp repo on more complex topics, well complex compared to this repo.

18/Sept : Wow, it has been so fast since I started C# programming. This is now completed, of course as said earlier, if there are any major or minor problems, issue it and I'll try my best to solve it. You can also pull request to add more examples into each section. More help is appreciated. Through a change of heart, I'll not on my second CSharp repo just yet. I want to continue on my other projects, which is game making. :) If you wish for my next repo, just Watch this repo, Star it or Comment here, I'll alert you!

Progress = 100% [If there are any problems with code, issue it, I will look into it. Better yet pull request to fix it]
