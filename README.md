# CSharpBasic
My documentation on the basics of C# through practical examples.

Hello, so you’re someone who’ve stumbled upon this repo. Feel free to check it out. I’m basically putting together what I’ve learnt on C# for others. 

15/Sept : It's been a short while since I uploaded to this repo for the first time. I believe I've added most of the content for this repo, so there'll be less and less content update. After my progress meter reaches 100%, I'll only commit fixes and update previous code(please if there are any issues, report it to me through the 'Issues' tab), then I'll work on my second CSharp repo on more complex topics, well complex compared to this repo.

Progress = 85%
